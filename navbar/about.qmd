## {{< fa solid microchip >}} About me

Hi there,

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in the development and deployment of machine learning artifacts, using software engineering best practices. Outside of my professional environments, I'm mostly interested in the development of open-source projects, as well as researching topics I find intriguing. This personal blog is a place where I convey some of the findings I come across during my research or
my professional tasks as well as my takes on different topics that involve
data science and software engineering.
