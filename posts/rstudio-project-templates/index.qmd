Many works in the data science realm rely solely upon the data scientist/analyst to guarantee the project standardization and code reproducibility; unfortunately, this becomes a source of confusion/disorganization since everybody (even on the same team) have different work strategies. To help ensure that teams share the same project standards, RStudio offers a sort of cookiecutter, where you can develop (in form of packages) many templates to be shared amongst users on the same team.
